Caffeine Controls for Alfred
============

An AppleScript so you can easily control Caffeine from [Alfred App](http://alfredapp.com/). You will need Alfred and the Powerpack to use this.

Installation
----------------

To install Caffeine Controls in Alfred double click on the extension file: caffeine-controls.alfredextension

How to use
----------------

Once installed with Alfred you can run the following commands


    caff on     ::  Turn caffeine on indefinitely
    caff 5      ::  Turn caffeine on for 5 minutes (the # can be changed to any number)
    caff off    ::  Turn caffeine off
    caff quit   ::  Quit caffeine (can also use 'caff end')
    caff start  ::  Start caffeine (can also use 'caff init')


Notes
----------------
If caffeine is not active and you turn it on with either 'caff on' or 'caff #', it will automatically start the Caffeine application for you. You do not have to call 'caff start' first.
